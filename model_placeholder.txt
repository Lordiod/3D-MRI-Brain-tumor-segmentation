# Model Files

This directory should contain the trained model file `model_x1_1.h5`.

## Download Instructions

To use this application, you need to:

1. **Train your own U-Net model** using the provided notebook in `building the model/`
   - Download the BraTS2020 dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation
   - Set up GPU environment (see README.md GPU Setup section)
   - Follow the training notebook step-by-step
   - Training time: 24-48 hours on modern GPU

2. **Or download a pre-trained model** compatible with this application
3. **Place the model file** as `model_x1_1.h5` in the root directory of this project

## Dataset Information

**BraTS2020 Dataset**:
- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation
- **Size**: ~4GB compressed, ~40GB extracted
- **Content**: 369 training cases with 4 MRI sequences each
- **Sequences**: T1, T1CE, T2, FLAIR + ground truth segmentations
- **Format**: NIfTI (.nii.gz) files
- **Resolution**: 240×240×155 voxels

**Usage**:
- Extract to `Data/BraTS2020_TrainingData/` directory
- The training notebook will automatically process the data
- Preprocessing includes normalization, cropping, and augmentation

## System Requirements for Training

- **TensorFlow**: 2.10.0
- **CUDA**: 11.2
- **cuDNN**: 8.1
- **GPU**: NVIDIA with 8GB+ VRAM recommended

## Model Requirements

The model should be a TensorFlow/Keras model (.h5 format) that:
- Takes two input channels (FLAIR and T1CE MRI sequences)
- Outputs 4-class segmentation predictions
- Is trained on 64x64 pixel images
- Processes 50 consecutive slices starting from slice 22

## Model Architecture

The expected model architecture is a U-Net for 3D brain tumor segmentation with:
- Input shape: (batch_size, 50, 64, 64, 2)
- Output shape: (batch_size, 50, 64, 64, 4)
- Classes: Background, Necrotic/Core, Edema, Enhancing tumor
